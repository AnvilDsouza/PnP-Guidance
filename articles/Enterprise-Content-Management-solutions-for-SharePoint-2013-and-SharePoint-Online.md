# Enterprise Content Management solutions for SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint Online
The Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution pack includes code samples and documentation that you can use to transition your SharePoint Online and SharePoint 2013 ECM solutions from full-trust code to the add-in model. 

    
 _**Applies to:** Office 365 | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint Online_

The samples in this solution pack show you how to use provider-hosted add-ins to perform common ECM tasks such as setting site policies, uploading files, or synchronizing term groups. The articles in this section will help you get started with and walk you through the primary scenarios that each sample illustrates. 

**Note**  You can use the  [Office 365 Developer Patterns and Practices](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP) project to [contribute](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/wiki/contributing-to-Office-365-developer-patterns-and-practices) to these samples.
