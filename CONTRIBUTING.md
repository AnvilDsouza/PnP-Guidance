  - Do not use emoticons, jargon, or slang in the code or articles.
  - Use lists and tables instead of long paragraphs where possible.
  - Avoid colloquialisms or region-specific language.
  - Use optional pronouns and articles (that, who, the) for clarity.
  - Include optional punctuation.
- Spell check and grammar check your document.
